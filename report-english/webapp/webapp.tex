\section{Web Application}
% On a l'architecture suivante :
% Client Web <-> Serveur Web <-> Base de données

The main purpose of the computer science team was to develop a sustainable web application that could enable the user to foresee his energy consumption and handle it.  This section introduce the design of this app in wich a database, a server and a web client are the main components. It has been built using the following architecture:

    \begin{figure}[!h] % montrer sur le schéma que le server ne fait que servir les données et que c'est le client qui doit en faire le traitement : http://fr.slideshare.net/scothis/aoa-mwa slide 19
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm]
    
        %%%%% verticale 
        % \node (client) [process, fill=green!10] {Client};
        % \node (server) [process, below of=client, fill=red!10] {Server};
        % \node (db) [process, below of=server, fill=blue!10] {Database};

        % \draw [arrow] (client) -- (server);
        % \draw [arrow] (server) -- (client);
        % \draw [arrow] (server) -- (db);
        % \draw [arrow] (db) -- (server);
        
        %%%% horizontale
        \node (client) [process, fill=green!10] {Client};
        \node (server) [process, right of=client, xshift=3cm, fill=red!10] {Server};
        \node (db) [process, right of=server, xshift=3cm , fill=blue!10] {Database};

        \draw [arrow] (client) -- (server);
        \draw [arrow] (server) -- (client);
        \draw [arrow] (server) -- (db);
        \draw [arrow] (db) -- (server);
