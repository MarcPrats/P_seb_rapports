\section{Research}

The strength of our device lies in its ability to determine precisely which device is turned on or not. Thankfully, each device has a specific load curve, and analyzing different points of the load curve allows us to determine when a device turns on. Two different approach were proceeded, a macroscopic and a microscopic one. The main difference between them are the sampling frequency and the focused points of the curves. The macroscopic approach require about 1Hz and study the whole form of the load curve whereas, for the microscopic one, it require between 5 and 10 kHz and study the transient response.
