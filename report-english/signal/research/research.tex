\section{Research}

The strength of our device lies in its ability to determine precisely which device is turned on or not. Thankfully, each device has a specific load curve, and analyzing different points of the load curve helps to determine when a device turns on. Two different approaches were proceeded, a macroscopic and a microscopic one. The main difference between them are the sampling frequency and the focused points of the curves. The macroscopic approach requires about 1Hz and studies the whole form of the load curve whereas, for the microscopic one, it requires between 5 and 10 kHz and studies the transient response.
