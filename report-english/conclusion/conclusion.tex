\section{Team Management and Conclusion}
Team Management was an important part of this project. Because it gather people from two minor of the Telecommunication department, communication needed to be perfect throughout the project. The first day, tools were chosen to make it easier. Git for code sharing, publishing, reviewing, testing... Azendoo for discussion about aspects of the project, and team meeting every week to assure that no problem could raise due to communication at any step. Also each part of the project meet at multiple occasion with the client to check if our proposal was matching there demands. To develop as close as possible with clients, a testing version of the webapp was made available online.\\\\

To sum up this project, it was a great opportunity to test our capacity to collaborate with people not working on the same application. On the signal processing part, there is steel work to do, the microscopic detection has just been started, while the macroscopic application can be enhance further.
